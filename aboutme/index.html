    <p>Hello everybody!. I hope everyone is learning and having fun as I am. I was born and raised<br>
    in Mexico, the land of mariachi and big sombrero...si señor. I am a Spanish native speaker.</p>
    <p>In January 2006, I enrolled in college in New Jersey, to learn English as a second language.<br>
    I spent almost a year taking English classes, but then by midd 2006 I meet a beautiful girl named<br>
    Cari from California. Before the end of 2006, I moved to California where she was from, and we<br>
    got married in January of 2007, Ever since, she's been my English teacher. I am expanding my<br> 
    bocabulary by learning new words every day, and loving it!. In 2008, we were sealled in the Sacramento<br>
    Temple. Together we have 6 beautiful children. The youngest one was born on Easter 2023, just 2 weeks ago.</p>
    <p>I love rivers, mountains, thunderstorms, rain, windy weather and everything that has to do with nature.</p>
    <p>I work in the apparel decoration industry. I do graphic design for a company. After being in<br>
    the workforce for many years, I have decided to go back to school. I should of<br>
    done this many years ago. It is what it is. The most important thing is that I am here today,<br>
    pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer programming. I won't rest until I achieve this goal.</p>
    <p>Pursuing a degree is challenging, but it can be very rewarding. I am not doing this alone, I<br>
    have invited the Savior as my coach in this journey.</p>
    <p>I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints since 1995. I was baptized<br>
    in Mexico City.</p>
    <p>"One of my favorite quotes from president Monson is: “In this life, where we have opportunities<br> 
    to strive and to achieve, I bear witness that on occasion we need to make a second effort—and<br> 
    a third effort, and a fourth effort, and as many degrees of effort as may be required to accomplish<br> 
    what we strive to achieve.” One of my favorite scripture is: Ether 12:6 And now, I, Moroni, would<br> 
    speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are<br> 
    hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until<br> 
    after the trial of your faith.</p>
    <p>I look forward to work, learn with and from everyone in this class. Thanks for visiting my site.</p>
